# TnB-2020-Model-Resources
Decompiled &amp; extracted files that I've used for TnB model edits.

Comes with .blend files that I used for compilation or editing. Primarily character models and what not. If you're seeing this github, it's probably because I or someone I know or someone who knows a person I know/knew gave it to you to delve into.

# What is in this thing?
MDL files, SMD files, QC files of almost everything I actually worked on, including:

-Reworked HL:A Clothing, edited and ported from an addon by jqueary, god bless

-Edited Combine Soldier models for playermodel use, credits to NinjaNub for creating them and BCQube for turning them into playermodels

-Metropolice ports from HL:A by jqueary, segmented into head/chest/legs

-"Posthuman" and "Transhuman"-style heads I've made in Character Creator v3.30

-Some other assorted heads or whatever

A few more things beyond counting. Most of it won't have materials, but I've made sure to at least include the metrocop diffuse PSDs. Any thing else you'll have to get yourself either from the source (Half-life Alyx, for the most part) or from the addon that I took it from.
